#Best Screen Recorders on Linux

If you are on linux like me, good screen recorders are hard to find and get working.

Screen recorders are essential to anyone. Whether it is for Gaming, or just to show your
friends a cool screenshot. Since most of the well known softwares for capturing your screen
are on Windows, people look for screen recorders and find that they need to use the terminal to capture
their screen. Here is my list of my 3 screen recorders that I use.

##1. Kazam

Kazam is the best screen recorder I have found so far. It is simple and gets the job done. The quality of the 
video is fantastic(HD) and it rarely affects my computer speed. This is easily a must have for any linux computer.

##2. GTK UV Video Viewer
What is this? Its a software that gets  feed from your webcam. Allowing you to record you face while gaming it up.
Install here  for ubuntu: [Camera](apt:guvcview)


##3. Shutter
Finally the best software for screenshots on Ubuntu. Many ways to export and simple gui makes a great piece of software.

Install here from software center: [Shutter](apt://shutter)
