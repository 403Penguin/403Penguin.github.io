#My Favorite Screen Recorders

If you are on linux like me, good screen recorders are hard to find and get working.

Screen recorders are essential to anyone. Whether it is for Gaming, or just to show your
friends a cool screenshot. Since most of the well known softwares for capturing your screen
are on Windows, people look for screen recorders and find that they need to use the terminal to capture
their screen. Here is my list of my 3 screen recorders that I use.

##1 Kazam

Kazam is the best screen recorder I have found so far. It is simple and gets the job done. The quality of the 
video is fantastic(HD) and it rarely affects my computer speed. This is easily a must have for any linux computer.
```bash
Install it on Ubuntu 13.04
Add repository
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kazam-team/stable-series

Update
sudo apt-get update

Install
sudo apt-get install kazam
```
